Breast cancer detection using machine learning involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in medical data, such as mammograms, histopathological images, and patient records. The process typically begins with collecting and pre-processing data to ensure quality and consistency. Commonly used algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. These models are trained on labeled datasets to distinguish between benign and malignant cases. Techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning optimize model performance. Advanced methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are particularly effective for image analysis, identifying tumors with high accuracy. Machine learning models can assist radiologists by providing a second opinion, reducing diagnostic errors, and accelerating the detection process. Continuous model refinement with new data ensures improved accuracy and reliability, ultimately enhancing early detection and treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients.
